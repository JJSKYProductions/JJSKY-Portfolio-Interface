        <p>Prokon is a steel frame planning software that was meant to utilize the help of AI to help decide what type of steele beams would need to be purchased or made to support a 3d rendered structure. I was asked by the commissioner to create a short teasert that would showcase a perfect use for the application's capabilities. I used unreal engine 5 to build a metal gazeebo and ran a camera around the structure to show its features. then panned out of a giant banner to end the video.</p>
