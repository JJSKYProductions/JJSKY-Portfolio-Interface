We recorded multiple speeches and stage performances during the event and took pictures of marketing stalls and event attendiees all to compile this video and added subtitles to help interperate local accesnts that were not easily audible for computer generation.</p>

          <p>Gaming video recorded on OBS studio though a game stream portal. Live video banners were added to the vidoe bottom right corner with my website address and a live stream recording of my in-game reacions. The subtitle caprions that appeared over my avatar were to interperate my speech during the gameplay as the sound effects would obscure my words. multilple HUD like counters were added to record the times i restarted the game.</p>
